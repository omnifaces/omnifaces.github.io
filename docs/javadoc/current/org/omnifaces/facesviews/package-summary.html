<div class="block"><p>
 This package contains the classes for the OmniFaces' FacesViews feature.

 <h3>Introduction</h3>

 <p>
 FacesViews is a feature where a special dedicated directory (<code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>), or optionally
 one or more user specified directories, can be used to store Facelets source files.

 <p>
 All files found in these directory are automatically mapped as Facelets files
 and made available using both their original extension as well as without an extension (extensionless). Optionally scanning
 can be restricted to include only certain extensions.

 <p>
 With FacesViews, there is thus no need to list all Facelets views that should be accessed without an extension in
 some configuration file. Additionally, it thus automatically maps Facelets files to their original file extension, which
 prevents exposing the source code of those Facelets that happens with the default JSF mapping.

 <p>
 In Servlet 3.0 containers, scanning is done automatically and no further configuration is needed. The feature
 is compatible with applications that don't have <code>web.xml</code> or <code>faces-config.xml</code> configuration
 files. As such, it can be used as an alternative to declaring the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/faces/webapp/FacesServlet.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in javax.faces.webapp"><code>FacesServlet</code></a> in <code>web.xml</code>
 for the <code>.xhtml</code> to <code>.xhtml</code> mapping.

 <p>
 <b>Example 1:</b>

 <p>
 Consider the following file structure and assume no further configuration has been done:

 <pre>
    /WEB-INF/faces-views/index.xhtml
    /WEB-INF/faces-views/users/add.xhtml
    /normal.xhtml
 </pre>

 <p>
 This will make the Facelets available via the following URLs (given a root deployment on domain <code>example.com</code>):

 <pre>
    example.com/index
    example.com/users/add
    example.com/index.xhtml (will direct to /index by default)
    example.com/users/add.xhtml (will direct to /users/add by default)
    example.com/normal.xhtml
 </pre>

 <p>
 Note that although the directory outside <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> is not scanned, the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/faces/webapp/FacesServlet.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in javax.faces.webapp"><code>FacesServlet</code></a>
 <em>is</em> mapped on all extensions found in <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>, so this will also affect files outside
 this directory. In the above example <code>normal.xhtml</code> is thus also available via the <code>.xhtml</code> extension, since
 the whole FacesServlet is mapped on this.

 <p>
 Also note that the extension variants of the scanned views will redirect to the extensionless variants. This behavior can be changed (see below),
 so that these views are either directly available (no redirect) or are not available at all.

 <p>
 <b>Example 2:</b>

 <p>
 Consider the following <code>web.xml</code>:

 <pre>
    &lt;context-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;org.omnifaces.FACES_VIEWS_SCAN_PATHS&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;/*.xhtml&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/context-param&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
 And this file structure:

 <pre>
    /page1.xhtml
    /foo/page2.xhtml
    /WEB-INF/resources/template.xhtml
    /script.js
 </pre>

 <p>
 This will make the Facelets available via the following URLs (given a root deployment on domain <code>example.com</code>):

 <pre>
    example.com/page1
    example.com/foo/page2
    example.com/page1.xhtml (will direct to /page1 by default)
    example.com/foo/page2.xhtml (will direct to /foo/page2 by default)
 </pre>

 <p>
 Note that in the above example, <code>/WEB-INF</code> was NOT scanned and thus <code>template.xhtml</code> is not made publicly available. Likewise
 <code>/script.js</code> was also not scanned since it doesn't have the configured extension (<code>.xhtml</code>). Finally, although a <code>web.xml</code> was used, there
 does not need to be a mapping for the <code>FacesServlet</code> in it when using a Servlet 3.0 container.

 <h3>Welcome files</h3>

 <p>
 If a <code>&lt;welcome-file&gt;</code> is defined in <code>web.xml</code> that's scanned by FacesViews <strong>AND</strong> <code>REDIRECT_TO_EXTENSIONLESS</code> is used
 (which is the default, see below), it's necessary to define an extensionless welcome file to prevent a request to <code>/</code> being redirected to
 <code>/[welcome file]</code>. E.g. without this <code>http://example.com</code> will redirect to say <code>http://example.com/index</code>.

 <p>
 For example:

 <pre>
    &lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
        &lt;welcome-file&gt;index&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
    &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;
 </pre>

 <h3>Dispatch methods</h3>

 <p>
 JSF normally inspects the request URI to derive a logical view id from it. It assumes the FacesServlet is either mapped on a prefix path
 or an extension, and will get confused when an extensionless "exactly mapped" request is encountered. To counter this, FacesViews
 makes use of a filter that intercepts each request and makes it appear to JSF that the request was a normal extension mapped one.

 <p>
 In order to do this dispatching, two methods are provided; forwarding, and wrapping the request and continuing the filter chain.
 For the last method to work, the FacesServlet is programmatically mapped to every individual resource (page/view) that is encountered. By
 default the filter is automatically registered and is inserted <b>after</b> all filters that are declared in <code>web.xml</code>.

 <p>
 These internal details are important for users to be aware of, since they greatly influence how extensionless requests interact with other
 filter based functionality such as security filters, compression filters, file upload filters, etc.

 <p>
 With the forwarding method, filters typically have to be set to dispatch type <code>FORWARD</code> as well. If the FacesView filter is the first
 in the chain other filters that are set to dispatch type <code>REQUEST</code> will <strong>NOT</strong> be invoked at all (the chain is ended). If the
 FacesView filter is set to be the last, other filters will be invoked, but they should not modify the response (a forward clears
 the response buffer till so far if not committed).

 <p>
 No such problems appear to exist when the FacesView filter simply continues the filtering chain. However, since it wraps the requess there
 might be unforeseen problems with containers or other filters that get confused when the request URI changes in the middle of the chain.
 Continuing the chain has been tested with JBoss EAP 6.0.1, GlassFish 3.1.2.2, WebLogic 12.1.1 and TomEE 1.5.2-snapshot and thus with both
 Mojarra and MyFaces. However, since it's a new method for OmniFaces 1.4 we kept the existing forward as an alternative.

 <p>
 The configuration options below provide more details about the dispatch methods and the filter position which can be used for tweaking
 FacesViews for interoperability with other filters.

 <h3>Configuration</h3>

 <p>
 The following context parameters are available.

 <td>Used to completely switch scanning off.
 <br>Allowed values: {<code>true</code>,<code>false</code>}
 <br>Default value: <code>true</code>
 <br>(note that if no <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> directory is present and no explicit paths have been configured, no scanning will be done either)</td>
 </tr>

 <td>A comma separated list of paths that are to be scanned in addition to <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>.
 <br>Allowed values: any path relative to the web root, including the root path (<code>/</code>) and <code>/WEB-INF</code>.
 A wildcard can be added to the path, which will cause only files with the given extension te be scanned.
 <br>Examples:
 <br>- Scan all files in both folder1 and folder2: <code>/folder1, /folder2</code>
 <br>- Scan only .xhtml files in the root: <code>/*.xhtml</code>
 <br>Note that when the root path is given, all its sub paths are also scanned EXCEPT <code>WEB-INF</code>, <code>META-INF</code> and <code>resources</code>.
 If those have to be scanned as well, they can be added to the list of paths explicitly.
 <br>Default value: <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> (note when this value is set, those paths will be in addition to the default <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code>)

 <h3>Servlet 2.5 configuration</h3>

 <p>
 Servlet 2.5 users will have to install the <a href="../../../org/omnifaces/facesviews/FacesViewsForwardingFilter.html" title="class in org.omnifaces.facesviews"><code>FacesViewsForwardingFilter</code></a> and
 <a href="../../../org/omnifaces/facesviews/FacesViewsViewHandler.html" title="class in org.omnifaces.facesviews"><code>FacesViewsViewHandler</code></a> manually in <code>web.xml</code>:

 <pre>
    &lt;filter&gt;
        &lt;filter-name&gt;FacesViewsForwardingFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;
        &lt;filter-class&gt;org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViewsForwardingFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;
    &lt;/filter&gt;
    &lt;filter-mapping&gt;
        &lt;filter-name&gt;FacesViewsForwardingFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/filter-mapping&gt;

    &lt;context-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;org.omnifaces.FACES_VIEWS_DISPATCH_METHOD&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;FORWARD&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/context-param&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
 Note that the <code>FORWARD</code> method has been set. Without that, the FacesServlet has to be mapped manually (also in web.xml) to
 each and every view that is used. This is similar to how the welcome file (see below) has to be mapped to the FacesServlet for Servlet
 2.5 users.

 <p>
 When an extensionless welcome file is defined in <code>web.xml</code> (see above), the FacesServlet has to be explicitly mapped
 to this welcome file for Servlet 2.5. E.g.

 <pre>
    &lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
        &lt;welcome-file&gt;index&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
    &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;

    &lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;facesServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt;javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
        &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
    &lt;/servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;facesServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.xhtml&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/welcome&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
 And this in <code>faces-config.xml</code>

 <pre>
    &lt;application&gt;
        &lt;view-handler&gt;org.omnifaces.facesviews.FacesViewsViewHandler&lt;/view-handler&gt;
    &lt;/application&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
 <em>(at the moment Servlet 2.5 compatibility has not been tested thorougly)</em>

 <h3>OmniFaces 1.3 compatibility</h3>

 <p>
 In OmniFaces 1.4, a major overhaul was done for FacesViews and several things are done differently from how they
 were done in 1.3

 <p>
 Most notably is that the FacesServlet dispatch changed from forwarding to continuing the chain, the FacesView filter
 moved from being the first in the chain to being the last, links are always rendered as their extensionless variant independent
 of the request using an extension or not, and when a request with an extension is used anyway (e.g. by typing it directly into
 the address bar) it's now redirected to the extensionless variant.

 <p>
 By putting the following settings in <code>web.xml</code> a behavior that most closely resembles 1.3 can be obtained:

 <pre>
    &lt;context-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;org.omnifaces.FACES_VIEWS_DISPATCH_METHOD&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;FORWARD&lt;/param-value&gt;
